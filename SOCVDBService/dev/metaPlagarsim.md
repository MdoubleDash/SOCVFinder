#When is an answer plagiarism and should be flagged for moderator attention?

This question is inspired after a long discussion, where no consensus was achieved but nicely summarized by [eis](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) in this [chat message](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) 

> According to Wikipedia, "The idea [of plagiarism] remains problematic with unclear definitions and unclear rules.", and they give [several definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism#Academia) of which some include intent to benefit from such act and some say it needs to be deliberate. I think it's fair to say that there are different definitions of it, some mention intent explicitly, some don't.

Currently on SE plagiarized answer are handled with custom mod flag, if the flag is correct the user will receive a warning (comment or maybe mod message), possibly deletion or suspension.

The discussion in this meta is what is the threshold to consider an answer plagiarized, currently in [help center](http://stackoverflow.com/help/referencing)

> Plagiarism - posting the work of others with no indication that it is not your own

Help center continues with how to provide correct attribution (provide a link to the original page or answer, provide the name of the original author)

Fairly often however on Stack Overflow we see answer from new user that pass "non" answer like

> `Copied large block of code or entire post from other answer`

> Thanks UserName, that worked great!!!

or

![Example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i4noi.png)

My "instinct" on these answer has been to flag as NAA (Not An Answer), passing comment as you can see in screen shot, however the attribution part is not correct since it has copied text from [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21842390/5292302)

**This brings up some considerations.**

- Is intent to benefit from plagiarism needed?

*or*

- *"No indication that it is not your own*", are we more tolerant to new users, hence we don't expect them to know how to provide correct attribution, format ecc and in this case we should look at context, when needed we help them to edit and in this case just flag it NAA? 

*or*

- The correct way to always indicated that they are not providing correct attribution and custom mod flag **all** answers that do not provide correct attribution as plagiarism, in this case skipping the LQP queue.

Please note:
I am excluding the case where it can be difficult to see the thanks, please help part, hence it is more helpful to in any case raise a custom mod flag to avoid review queue and help moderator to evaluate it correctly.
