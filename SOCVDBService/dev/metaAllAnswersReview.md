# Show all answers in review queue

*This is request is related specifically to the following queues Low Quality Posts, First Posts and Late Answers, however it could also be useful for other queue as for example the [Close Votes Queue](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/172931/please-put-answers-underneath-questions-in-close-review-queue)*

I was prompted to ask for this feature after I messed up this [review](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/352198/). 

I agree!, the last sentence *"Works for me! Thank you Oleksii !"* should have made me visit the whole Q/A, mea culpa.

**but**

even without that sentence it would have been a plagiarized post, which brings me to the conclusion that if you like to review correctly before pressing "Looks Ok" you always need to visit the whole Q/A in a new tab, to me there is no doubt that seeing the other answers while reviewing Late Answers or Low Quailty Post is useful and can determine the action that needs to be taken.


[Shog9](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/811/shog9) once [stated](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/153002/320339):

> I really can't think of a better UI than that. /review shows you one post at a time (+ the question, for answers) - when that's not enough, open a new tab with the full question and all the answers.

I however think [animuson](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/141525/animuson) [idea](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/172931/please-put-answers-underneath-questions-in-close-review-queue#comment513749_172931) or something similar is much more efficient.

> I don't think they should be expanded by default (or maybe only one expanded by default), but I'd like an easy way to import the answers into the same review screen rather than opening another window/tab.

Considering also the [drop of reviewing](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/349125/5292302) on Stack Overflow, letâ€™s throw in a new feature for the few brave to make them faster and more accurate.
